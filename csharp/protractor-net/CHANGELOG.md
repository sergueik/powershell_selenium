* Added methods from [protractor/clientsidescripts.js](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/lib/clientsidescripts.js). Code in the fork [sergueik/protractor-net](https://github.com/sergueik/protractor-net) is dormant until all changes are in place.
* Added tests for [ng-repeat](http://www.java2s.com/Tutorials/AngularJSDemo/n/ng_repeat_start_and_ng_repeat_end_example.htm)
* Added tests for [ng-repeat-start and ng-repeat-end-with-example demo](http://www.ecofic.com/about/blog/displaying-groups-with-angularjs-ng-repeat-start-and-ng-repeat-end-with-example/demo).
