## Security Warning

It has come to my attention from the *HP Enterprise Security Group* that using the `$type` extension has the potential to be unsafe, so use it with **common sense** and known json sources and not public facing ones to be safe.

## Security Warning Update
I have added `JSONParameters.BlackListTypeChecking` which defaults to `true` to check for known `$type` attack vectors from the paper published from *HP Enterprise Security Group*, when enabled it will throw an exception and stop processing the json.
